This directory contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for Foxpad.

Foxpad is an online service that allows users from remote locations to listen simultaneously to music online via the browser. Users can login through their Google accounts and start hosting a session right away. From there, a unique URL is generated that can be sent to all your friends to join and listen in real-time.

Foxpad is still being developed.
